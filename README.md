# NFV Data Centers: A Systematic Literature Review
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of NFV applications in the data center. Therefore, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted aimed at studying and synthesizing the available works in the NFV state-of-the-art. Consequently, about 1,408 papers have been analyzed and filtered, evidencing a total of 65 relevant studies. This paper documents the relevance of the 65 papers, as well as provides an indepth insight into the primary open research questions concerning NFV architecture. In particular, highlighting the need for consolidating the integration of NFV in data centers by solving problems related to performance, dependability, resource allocation, cost, management, and resource interoperability. Based on the conducted SLR, several research gaps and open challenges have been identified, allowing the authors to provide new propositions and suggested future research avenues. Finally, the obtained results have shown that there is a strong need for further collaboration between academia and industry to conduct quality research and advance NFV practical implementations.
